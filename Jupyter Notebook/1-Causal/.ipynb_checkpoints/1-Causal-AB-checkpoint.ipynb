    "This document is on a brief introduction to an important methodology used for data analysis/data science in a wide range of scientific and practical fields: Causal Inference, the development of which has become the norm for quantitative social sciences and, therefore, has led to the 2021 Nobel prize in economic sciences. We will start with the potential outcome model framework to discuss the core challenge in causal inference: missing outcome values and demonstrate why and how selection bias arises to ruin reliable causal inferences. Based on this framework, we will introduce A/B testing, which is also referred to as randomized controlled trials/randomized experiments in other contexts (such as medicine or statistics), as the gold standard that completely rules out selection bias and, thus, provide unbiased estimation of the causal effect. Demonstration code to estimate the average treatment effect with data from randomized experiments and the experiment design issues will be introduced. \n",

    "Let us first consider the following example that illustrates the difficulty of causal inference. Consider a survey conducted by National Health Interview, in which patients who visited the emergency department (ED) of a hospital were recorded at discharge. Moreover, each patient's health status when s/he leaves the hospital is also recorded in the survey. In this survey, 1 refers to poor health whereas 5 refers to excellent health. We want to examine the effectiveness of hospitization on patient health and have the following table, where the row \"Hospitalized\" means for the patients who are hospitalized; and the row \"Not hospitalized\" means for the patients who are asked to directly go home without hospitalization:    \n",

With the data from this health interview survey, can we conclude from the above table that hospitalization actually **makes** patients unhealthy? The answer is **No**, because only if a patient is seriously ill in the first place will s/he be hospitalized. Therefore, the patients who are hospitalized and those who are not hospitalized are not drawn from the same population distribution as those who are sent back home directly. In other words, these two groups of patients are <font color=\"red\"> **not comparable** </font>.\n",

In this case, can we conclude that coupon will **decrease the user activeness of Didi**? The answer is also **No**. This is because Didi will more likely to offer coupons to users/riders who are less active on the platform. To this regard, users who receive the coupon are not drawn from the same population distribution as those who do not receive the coupon.

    "We call the unseen information about each individual the **counterfactual**. For example, for the Didi users who have received (resp. not received) the coupon, the counterfactual is what they would have behaved if not receiving (resp. if receiving) the coupon. The key to successful causal inference is **rigorous reasoning about counterfactuals** by constructing **reasonable benchmarks**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most widely used framework to analyze counterfactuals is called the potential outcomes model ([Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_causal_model)). We consider the case of two possible actions applied to each individual, denoted by $W$:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $W=1$ refers to the \"treatment\" action, such as a patient is hospitalized or a Didi user receives a coupon.\n",
    "- $W=0$ refers to the \"control\" action, such as a patient is not hospitalized or a Didi user does not receive a coupon.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each individual, there are two potential outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $Y(1)$: The outcome of the individual if treatment is applied. For example, the health status of a patient if hospitalized; or the activeness of a Didi user if receiving the coupon.\n",
    "- $Y(0)$: The outcome of the individual if control is applied. For example, the health status of a patient if not hospitalized; or the activeness of a Didi user if not receiving the coupon.\n",

    "\n",
    "$$\\mbox{Causal Effect}=Y(1)-Y(0)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The most fundamental problem in causal inference is an issue of missing data: For each individual, we either observe the treatment outcome $Y(1)$, or the control outcome $Y(0)$, but not both. For example, if a patient is hospitalized (resp. not hospitalized), we can only observe his/her health status under hospitalization (resp. without hospitalization) but not that without hospitalization (resp. under hospitalization). Analogously, if a Didi user receives the coupon (resp. does not receive the coupon), we can only observe his/her activeness upon receiving the coupon (resp. without receiving the coupon) but not that without receiving the coupon (resp. upon receiving the coupon).\n",

    "To answer this question, we fully formalize our potential outcomes model for the sample. Consider the potential outcomes of all $n$ individuals in the data sample: $\\{Y_i(1),Y_i(0):1\\le i\\le n\\}$. We define the assignment mechanism as $\\mathcal W=\\{W_i\\in\\{0,1\\}:1\\le i\\le n\\}$, where $W_i=1$ means individual $i$ is assigned to the treatment group whereas $W_i=0$ means individual $i$ is assigned to the control group. Therefore, the data we could observe for individual $i$ is $Y_i(W_i)$, but not $Y_i(1-W_i)$. We denote $\\mathcal D=\\{(Y_i(W_i),W_i):1\\le i\\le n\\}$ as the observed data set. We denote $n_1$ as the number of individuals in the treatment group, and $n_0$ as the number of individuals in the control group. \n",

This is implemented in the following manner: Randomly assign users into the treatment group (new strategy applied) and the control group (baseline strategy applied). This is the **only difference** between these two groups. \n",

    "## 4.1. Internal Validity and External Validity\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we discuss some fundamental issues for experiment design. The first is the **<font color=\"red\">internal validity</font>** and **<font color=\"red\">external validity</font>**. We use the following figure to illustrate the internal and external validities:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"validity.png\" width=750>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**<font color=\"red\">Internal validity</font>** refers to that subjects are randomly assigned to treatment and control groups and, as a consequence, there is no difference between the treated subjects and the controlled subjects, other than the treatment itself, that could affect the outcome. Under internal validity, there will be **no confounding factors** in the estimated factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case above about the A/B testing on Didi platform's coupon (in [Section 3](#section_3)), the internal validity is satisfied. However, for the case of hospitalization and the toy example of Didi coupon (in [Section 1](#section_1)), the internal validity is violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical threats to internal validity include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **<font color=\"red\">Failure of randomization:</font>** For example, the implementing partner of the experiment (say, the hospital who conducts a clinical trial) assigns its favorites to the treatment group; the imbalance of treatment and control groups due to small sample size, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **<font color=\"red\">Non-compliance with the experimental protocol:</font>** For example, some members of the control group receive the treatment and some members of the treatment group go untreated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **<font color=\"red\">Differential attrition:</font>** For example, in a clinical trial, control group subjects are more likely to drop out of a study than treatment group subjects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**<font color=\"red\">External validity</font>** refers to that the sample under evaluation accurately represents the entire population. Under external validity, the experiment is conducted on a random sampling of the whole population. External validity would fail if the treatment would have a different effect outside the experimental environment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Typical threats to external validity include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **<font color=\"red\">Non-representative sample:</font>** For example, in some lab experiments to examine a management problem, the undergraduate students are used. Sometimes, although the subjects are randomly sampled, but they are not from the population of interest. Like in a clinical trial, the new drug is designed to treat end-stage lung cancer, but it recruits early-stage lung cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **<font color=\"red\">Non-representative treatment:</font>** For example, the treatment in the experiment is different from the actual implementations. Like in a clinical trial, the patients in the treatment group are very carefully examined and taken care of, which may not be the case if the drug is actually used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, people believe **<font color=\"red\">internal validity is more important than external validity</font>**. If you do not know the effects of the treatment on the units in your study, you are not well-positioned to infer the effects on units you did not study who live in circumstances you did not study. If randomization well executed, the internal validity of a randomized experiment is ensured. External validity can be partially addressed by comparing the results of several internally valid studies conducted for different samples in different circumstances and at different times. However, fully addressing external validity is impossible as long as your sample is NOT the full population."

    "## 4.3. Minimum Sample Size of A/B Tests\n",

    "Therefore, the minimum sample size of an A/B test should be the one such that the Type-I error rate (i.e., significance level) is $\\alpha$ and the Type-II error rate (i.e., 1-statistical power) is $\\beta$. Usually, we set $\\alpha=0.05$ and $\\beta\\le0.2$. This is illustrated in the following figure, where the red curve is the distribution of $\\widehat{ATE}$ under the null hypothesis that the treatment has **no effect**, and the blue curve is the distribution of $\\widehat{ATE}$ under the alternative hypothesis that the treatment has a **positive effective**. The [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_a_test) of a statistical test is defined as the probability of rejecting a null hypothesis under the ground-truth that the ATE is non-zero.\n",

    "We denote $n_{min}$ as the minimum sample size of the entire experiment, where $n_{min}/2$ of the subjects are in the treatment group and the other $n_{min}/2$ are in the control group. Assume that the experiment will not affect the standard deviation of the potential outcome, which we denote as $\\sigma$. In practice, any experiment has a minimum treatment effect that the researcher/experimenter can detect (sometimes also called minimum detectable effect, MDE), which we denote as $\\tau_{min}$. Recall that $z_{1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}$ is the $(1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2})$-percentile $z$-value of a standard normal distribution. Similarly, we define $z_{1-\\beta}$ as the $(1-\\beta)$-percentile $z$-value of a standard normal distribution. We use $\\hat\\sigma_{ATE}$ to denote the standard deviation of the estimator $\\widehat{ATE}$. Since $n_{min}/2$ of the subjects are in the treatment group and the other $n_{min}/2$ are in the control group and the standard deviation of the potential outcomes is $\\sigma$, we have the standard deviation of $\\widehat{ATE}$ is given by:\n",

    "Under the null hypothesis (i.e., $H_0$) that $ATE=0$, $\\widehat{ATE}$ will follow a normal distribution as the red curve above, with mean $0$ and standard deviation $\\hat\\sigma_{ATE}=\\frac{2\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n_{min}}}$. Since the significance of the statistical test is $\\alpha$, we will not reject $H_0$ if $\\widehat{ATE}\\le \\hat\\sigma_{ATE}z_{1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}$.\n",

Since the power of the statistical test is $1-\\beta$, we need that, as long as $H_0$ is rejected, i.e., $\\widehat{ATE}\\le \\hat\\sigma_{ATE}z_{1-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}}$, it must hold that $\\widehat{ATE}\\le \\tau_{\\min}-\\hat\\sigma_{ATE}z_{1-\\beta}$ as well.
